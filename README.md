# Mindful Presence iOS app
### Daily Alignment app - practice presence by connecting your goals with everyday actions  


**Mindful Presence is designed to help you cultivate a deeper connection with yourself through daily alignment practices. By setting clear intentions and acknowledging your emotions, you develop greater self-awareness and presence in your daily life.**

**Regular practice helps you stay grounded, make conscious choices, and live more intentionally. Our approach combines ancient wisdom with modern psychology to support your journey toward mindfulness and personal growth.**

# How to use

Daily alignments connect your life goals with everyday actions through two components: an intention (what you'll practice) and an emotion (how you'll embody it). 
1. Morning: Create an alignment with your intention, emotion, and optional checklist.  
2. Throughout the day: Pause when reminded to reconnect with your intention.
3. Evening: Add a reflection with a star rating and notes about your day.
